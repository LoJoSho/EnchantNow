# EnchantNow

A new enchantment plugin that makes enchanting items simply better... with integration with EcoEnchants as well.

Basic layout that makes it great:

``/command enchant1:level,enchant2:level,enchant3:level amount player``

``/enchantbook unbreaking:3,depth_strider:3,feather_falling:4 (1) (playerName)``

``/enchant unbreaking:3,depth_strider:3,feather_falling:4``

There is also a tab complete that allows you to pick enchantments easily.
